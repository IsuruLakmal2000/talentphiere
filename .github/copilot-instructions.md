## Project Overview
This is a React TypeScript project built with Vite and CSS. The project provides a modern development environment with:

- **React 18** with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- **Vite** for fast development server and optimized builds
- **CSS** for styling (no additional CSS frameworks included by default)
- **ESLint** for code linting and quality assurance

## Development Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all React components and utilities
- Follow React best practices and hooks patterns
- Write type-safe code with proper TypeScript interfaces and types
- Use CSS modules or regular CSS for styling
- Keep components modular and reusable
- Use proper error handling and loading states where appropriate

## Code Style
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer arrow functions for component definitions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep components small and focused on single responsibilities
- Use proper TypeScript typing for props and state
